# RedRover - String Formatter

Note: I would have used serialization but the requirements were just to manipulate the string so I did not want to assume anything. :)

## How to run 
1. There is an executable within the bin folder: `bin/Debug/net7.0/RedRover.exe`
2. This can be ran on the command line: E.g., `./bin/Debug/net7.0/RedRover`
